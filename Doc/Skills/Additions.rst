.. _Skill Additions:

**Skill Additions**
====================
Making a Skill addition is non-destructive and thus will be compatible with any other mods making additions to the same Skill.

Check **_SkillAdditionExample.json** for an example.

The overview will proceed to go over each key you would find in a regular Adventure .json, how their role changes, and if they're required in a addition.

.. note::
  All other keys outside of the ones listed aren't used, and thus should not be included for tidiness,
  **excluding these five**:

  ::

    "removesStance": "Provide/replace string found in base skill",
    "restraintStruggle": "Provide/replace string found in base skill",
    "restraintStruggleCharmed": "Provide/replace string found in base skill",
    "restraintEscaped": "Provide/replace string found in base skill",
    "restraintEscapedFail": "Provide/replace string found in base skill"
