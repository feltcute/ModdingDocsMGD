**File Hosting Your Mod**
=========================

This page will cover how to use Github, Gitlab, and Gitgud as a zip file host for your mod, **without having to use git.**

To begin, make an account on your platform of choice:

* `Gitgud <https://gitgud.io>`_ has no restrictions on NSFW content, and has many of their top repositories as examples, though smaller and less proven than the alternative hosts.
* `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/explore/projects>`_ is a larger platform than Gitgud with the same interface, but has the open risk of less permissive `use policies <https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/policies/website-terms-of-use/>`_.
* `Github <https://github.com/>`_ is the largest platform. While historically fairly permissive of various NSFW projects, keep in mind their `use policies <https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies>`_. **It also requires 2-factor authentication to use.**

Then use the respective tab for your chosen platform to create a new repository for your mod:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Gitgud

        1. `Create a project. <https://gitgud.io/projects/new#blank_project>`_

        2. Follow the prompts for naming, initializing a README, and making it Public:

        3. 

    .. tab:: Gitlab

        1. `Create a project. <https://gitlab.com/projects/new>`_

        2. Follow the prompts for naming, initializing a README, and making it Public:

        .. image:: img/GitlabCreation.png

    .. tab:: Github

        1. `Create a project. <https://github.com/new>`_

        2. Follow the prompts for naming, initializing a README, and making it Public:

        1. Add and create a ``Tag name`` equivalent to the version number of your release.

        .. image:: img/GitgudWriteRelease2.png
            :align: center

        1. In ``Release Title``, provide the name of your mod along with the version number.

        2. In ``Release notes``, use `markdown <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline->`_ to provide a brief and eye-catching summary of the update. Make sparing use of bold words to help visually prioritize points of your release.

           - Updated the mod's Perpetua monster json to feature the new markup syntax introduced in MGD v25.6.
