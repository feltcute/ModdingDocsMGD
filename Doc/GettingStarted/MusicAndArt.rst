.. _Music And Art Summary:

**Music & Art**
=================

.. warning:: 

    If using assets found online, always review licenses of copyrighted materials, and give credit to your sources.

**Mod Pathing**
----------------

Whenever a key or function asks for an image asset path, the game expects it to be in a base game directory by default.
This means *game/music/*, *game/sfx/*, or *game/images/*. 

This is a problem if you want to use assets stored within your mod folder since the game won't find it if it's looking for the asset file like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

  "images/Mods/<modName>/folder/file.png"

To correct this behavior, one has to prepend the file path to their asset file with ``../``. 
This will tell the game to go back up by one folder directory, landing it in */game*. It will look like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

  "../Mods/<modName>/folder/file.extensiontype"

Map related assets are the exception, as they're two directories deep for the base game assets: *images/map/*. 
You will need to use ``../`` twice in cases where you are making a new location on the map:

.. code-block:: javascript

  "../../Mods/<modName>/folder/file.extensiontype"

**Images**
-----------

MGD supports the following image file types:

* **PNG**: .png (recommended, and also specifically required for Location image backgrounds)
* **WEBP**: .webp (comparatively smaller at the same levels of quality as PNG)
* **JPG/JPEG** .jpg (not recommended due to transparency being unsupported by JPG files)

**Audio**
----------

Supported audio file types:

* **Opus**: .opus
* **Ogg Vorbis**: .ogg
* **MP3**: .mp3
* **WAV**: .wav (uncompressed 16-bit signed PCM only)

**Other**
----------

Additionally, when your mod is extracted in the Mods screen in-game, the following file types will be extracted as well:

* **Plain text**: .txt (Plain text files you'd write in a text editor, often for documentation purposes.)
* **Markdown**: .md (Like plain text, except it adheres to the Markdown markup standard.)
* **Avif**: .avif (A recently standardized image format, though it can't yet be used by the game.)
