**Event Creation**
===================

Breaks down the :doc:`keys and :term:`strings` </Doc/Tutorials/TheJsonFormat>` used by Events.

Base game Event .jsons are located at *Json/Events/*.
The bubble slime events showcase modern practices well, located at *Mountain/FizzySpring.json*, and *CombatEvents/BubbleSlimeCombatEvents.json*.

A blank template can be found at *Events/_BlankEvent.json*.

**Assume all :term:`keys` are required, unless stated otherwise.**

**name**
---------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "name": "Name of Event",

The name of the event is presented in the Grimoire and for internal referral.

.. _CardTypeCreation:

**CardType**
-------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "CardType": "Event",

Changes how the game calls and utilizes the event. See `CardType Values`_ below for all possible values.

**CardLimit**
""""""""""""""

* ``"CardLimit": "0",`` sets the maximum limit of ``"Event"`` CardTypes that can be added to the Grimoire by the player. Set to ``"0"`` if not used by the CardType, or for no limit to the amount of events.

**Description**
----------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "Description": "A description of the event",

When used for a Grimoire `CardType`_, it will present the :term:`string` you provide on the right hand side of in the Grimoire when players are reviewing events and quests for selection.

When used for town card types, providing it with the :term:`string` ``"EnterArea"`` will make it trigger when the player enters that location.

When used for brothel shift card types, using a different shift type will make it count for that shift too. Repeating the same shift type increase its chances.

**requires & requiresEvent**
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "requires": ["Vandal Note"],

Retrieve the ``"name:"`` key(s) of an :doc:`Item </Doc/Manual/Items/Items>` to use as a requirement for players to access the event, primarily for the Grimoire. Typically a :term:`key` Item.
The :term:`key` must be included, but the :term:`array` can be left empty. You can leave either a blank :term:`string` or none at all.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "requiresEvent": [
    {
    "NameOfEvent": "",
    "Progress": "-99",
    "ChoiceNumber": "-1",
    "Choice": ""
    }
  ],

A more complex and optional :term:`key` that contains :term:`objects` that will check for progress or choice in a event. It can be used in alongside or as an alternative to ``"requires":``.

Given it's an array, you can introduce multiple requirements of the same type by providing duplicate :term:`objects` for as long as it contains all four of the given keys.

You need to provide a :term:`value` for ``"Progress":`` and ``"ChoiceNumber":``, else it will not work. If you don't wish to use one of them, use the default :term:`values` above.
``"NameOfEvent":`` and ``"Choice":`` need at least empty strings.

If in use, you cannot exclude unused :term:`keys` in the object, they must all be present.
If ``"requiresEvent":`` isn't being used at all, it can be excluded from the file entirely.

.. _SpeakersCreation:

**Speakers**
-------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "Speakers": [
    {
    "name": "IDname of Monster",
    "postName": "",
    "SpeakerType": ""
    },
    {
    "name": "IDname of another Monster",
    "postName": " A postName.",
    "SpeakerType": ""
    }
  ],

``"Speakers":`` gives functionality for the ``"Speaks"`` function, used in dialogue. Each speaker will need to be put in a separate object.
Each :term:`object` added is correlated to a number in the ``"Speaks"`` function, starting from 2 for the second :term:`object` to a maximum of 12 added speakers,
ordered by each :term:`object` added from top to bottom.
See :doc:`Dialogue </Doc/Functions/General/Dialogue>` for more information on the ``"Speaks"`` function.

``"name":`` must be from the ``"IDname":`` :term:`key` of a :doc:`Monster </Doc/Manual/Monsters/Monsters>`. Don't worry, it will proceed to display the :term:`string` in the monster's ``"name":``,
not the IDname.

``"postName":`` will place the data provided in the :term:`string` after their name, for example, if you wanted to differentiate multiple generic monsters (Elf 1, Elf 2, etc).
Can use the ``"SetPostName"`` function to override it for all characters. See the function page :doc:`Speakers Specific </Doc/Functions/EventOnly/SpeakersSpecific>` for more information.

``"SpeakerType":`` currently only serves one purpose. If set to ``"?"`` will let you put in any name you wish for the ``"name":`` key, regardless if they even have a monster json.
Alternatively, the ``"Speak"`` function can be used instead. Otherwise, it can be left with an empty string.

While ``"Speakers":`` and at least one :term:`object` with the listed :term:`keys` must be included, it doesn't necessarily need to be used.
All :term:`keys` in the :term:`objects` require at least an empty string.

**EventText**
--------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "EventText": [
    {
    "NameOfScene": "EventStart",
    "theScene": [
      "While walking an intricate pink rune suddenly appears beneath you!",
      "Menu",
      "Do something!",
      "See what happens.",
      "EndLoop"
      ]
    },
    {
    "NameOfScene": "Do something!",
    "theScene": [
      "You trip on the pink rune and suffer a bad headache."
      ]
    },
    {
    "NameOfScene": "See what happens.",
    "theScene": [
      "It's a pink rune. It continues to exist defiantly."
      ]
    }
  ]

``"EventText":`` is an :term:`array` of :term:`objects` containing the series of scenes that will make up your event. Each :term:`object` will contain the exact same keys.

``"NameOfScene":``, which takes a :term:`string` you provide it to uniquely identify the scene. They can contain whatever you please.

``"theScene":`` which takes an :term:`array` of :term:`strings` that make up the scene. These :term:`objects` are plainly called scenes.
Your :term:`strings` will be displayed to the user as narrative text, unless it's identified as a function.

The first scene added will always display first for your average event jump from any of the ``"CardType":`` values.
However, specific scenes in a event can be jumped to, either by a game feature or by a function.

See :doc:`functions </Doc/Functions/index>` for the vast range of functions that can be used in scenes.

**Optional Scenes**
""""""""""""""""""""

When debugging scenes (see :ref:`notJumping` in FAQ), you may find yourself with scenes you don't intend to ever be linked to by a function. 
In this case, you can declare it as an optional scene to the game by prepending its ``"NameOfScene":`` :term:`value` with any of the following:

- An ``_`` underscore. Intended for any scenario where you want the debugger to ignore the scene, such as internal notes, cut content, or in-progress work not meant to be accessed by the player yet.
- ``event`` or uppercased ``Event``. Loosely intended for your starting and ending scenes, such as ``"EventStart"`` (your very first scene) and ``"EventBroke"`` (your very last scene).
- ``debug`` or uppercased ``Debug``. Loosely intended for scenes made for debugging purposes while making the event. Sometimes used in place of ``"EventBroke"`` as last scene.

      ]
    }

.. tip::

  Using ``"EventStart"``and ``"EventBroke"`` as advised is a recommended practice.
  
  The games in certain scenarios will jump to the first event in your scene, meaning you may not have any links to your first scene at all. Using ``"EventStart"`` consistently for this makes it never a guess to remember, and causes it to be flagged as optional.

  If you accidentally jump to a scene that doesn't exist due to accidents like spelling errors, the game will always jump to the last scene in the event. Having ``"EventBroke"`` as your last scene with an error message will better inform you when testing your mod, and causes it to be flagged as optional.
