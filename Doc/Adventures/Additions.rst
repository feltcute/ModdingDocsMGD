**Adventure Additions**
========================

Adventure additions cover overwriting the base Adventure's ``"Deck":`` key with your own data,
expanding the random monsters, monster groups, events, and loot from treasure.

This does mean your addition would be incompatible with other mods that make changes to the ``"Deck":`` key for the same Adventure.

Check **_AdventureAdditionExample.json** in *Json/Adventures/* for an example.

.. If you have installed the MGD extension, you can type ``_a_Adventure`` to create an Adventure addition snippet.

The overview will proceed to go over each key you would find in a regular Adventure .json, how their role changes, and if they're required in a addition.

.. note::

  ``"Eros":``, ``"requires":``, ``"requiresEvent":``, and ``"Description":`` aren't used, and thus should be excluded for tidiness.

**name & Addition**
--------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "name": "Forest Dungeon",

Required so you can tell the game which Adventure you wish to make an addition to.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "Addition": "Yes",

Required so you can tell the game that you're wishing to make an addition. Can be added into almost any part of the file.

**Deck**
---------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "Deck": [
    "Event", "Name of an event",
    "RandomTreasure",
    "BreakSpot",
    "Monster", "Imp", "EndLoop",
    "RandomEvent"
  ],

Required, ``"Deck":`` **cannot** be excluded, nor left empty, even if your goal isn't to modify the deck.

It is advised to copy and paste the array from the Adventure's original ``"Deck":`` key as the basis of your addition, and go from there.

**RandomEvents**
-----------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "RandomEvents": ["Lust Rune", "Ninja Rest Ambush"],

Using this key in a addition adds to the existing array. The strings provided in the original ``"RandomEvents":`` key will still be present, and not overridden.
As such, you are only increasing the selection of events, not replacing, unlike the ``"Deck":`` key.

**RandomMonsters & MonsterGroups**
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "RandomMonsters": ["Elf"],
  "MonsterGroups": [
    {
    "Group": ["Elf", "Elf"]
    }
  ],

Using these keys in an addition adds to the existing arrays, so the strings and objects provided in the original keys will still be present, not overwritten.
As such, you are only increasing the selection of monster groups, not replacing.

These keys are required, but the arrays can be left empty if you do not wish to use it. ``"MonsterGroups":`` does not require an object.

**Treasure**
-------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "Treasure": [
    {
    "Common": ["Anaph Herb", "Ugli Herb"]
    },

    {
    "Uncommon": ["Unbound Rune", "Unbound Rune", "Soothing Potion"]
    },

    {
    "Rare": ["Panacea", "Energy Potion", "Cock Ring of Justice", "Power Belt"]
    }
  ],

Using this key in a addition adds to the existing array, so the strings provided in the original key will still be present, and will not be overridden.
As such, you are only increasing the selection of loot, not replacing.

``"Treasure":`` and its objects are required, but the arrays can be left empty if you do not wish to use it.
