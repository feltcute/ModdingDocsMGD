**Stance Reference**
=====================

.. seealso:: 
    
    See :ref:`Stances` for information on functions related to stances, and :ref:`Stance Restraints` for information on lineTriggers related to specific stances.

**Any, None**
--------------

``"Any"``, or ``"None"`` can sometimes be checked for in certain cases to either cover any stance, or the lack of any stance.
The documentation for relevant functions and :term:`keys` will state whether these :term:`values` are an option.


**Player & Monster Stances**
-----------------------------

The following three stances can be initiated by both players and most monsters:

* ``"Sex"``
* ``"Anal"``
* ``"Making Out"``
* ``"Penetration"``

Penetration is an internal stance type that counts both Sex and Anal, for use in :doc:`Skills </Doc/Manual/Skills/Skills>` when checking for usability.
**It cannot be used for starting stances in functions, nor as a parameter for Loss/Victory scenes.**

**Monster Stances**
--------------------

The following stances can only be started by monster girls, and are meant to count towards particular fetishes:

* ``"Blowjob"``
* ``"Titfuck"``
* ``"Tailjob"``
* ``"Tail Fuck"`` (e.g. Tail Pussy)
* ``"Tail Pegging"``
* ``"Face Sit"``
* ``"Footjob"``
* ``"Breast Smother"``
* ``"Nursing"``
* ``"Thighjob"``
* ``"Thigh Grinding"``

**Specialty Stances**
---------------------

The following stances can only be started by monster girls, and are specialized with no particular fetishes.

* ``"Cuddle"``
* ``"Slimed"``
* ``"Slimed 50%"``
* ``"Slimed 100%"``


**Making Stances**
-------------------

Stances are completely nebulous. Anything can be a stance, and thus can be declared freely, there doesn't need to be any particular point of origin, nor followed rules.
Thus, it can be safely checked for or declared at any point in a function or key, even if it doesn't actually exist anywhere else yet.
Just remember they're case sensitive.

Note that player skills and other stances may require :ref:`Skill Additions` in order to be made fully aware of the custom stances in scenarios where it might not make
sense for a certain set of skills or stances to be available. For example, no Making Out or Kiss during a Head-Standing stance.
