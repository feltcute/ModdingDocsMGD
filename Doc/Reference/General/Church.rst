**Church**
===========

Keep in mind that using Church functions will trigger fixed dialogue from the Goddess, listed below.

* "Oh chosen hero... If you donate enough eros, I can remove the fetishes you have gained from your trials."
* "You dump eros into the donation cup and they disappear instantly."
* "A chill runs through your skull as your fantasies return to normal."

* "Oh, chosen hero... Your mind is as pure as it can be, but you may still donate if you wish."
* "Oh, chosen hero... It seems you don't have enough eros. I believe in you to get some so I may aid you."
* "Oh chosen hero... If you donate enough eros, I can remove the fetishes you have gained from your trials."
* "Oh, chosen hero... Your body is not in need of restoration, but you may still donate if you wish."

It is recommended to check */Json/Events/Town/Church/1VenereaeStatue.json* for a full context example of how it works in practice.
