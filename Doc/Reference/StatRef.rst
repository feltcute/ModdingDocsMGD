.. _Stats:

**Stat Reference**
===================
This page is purely for ease of reference for functions and keys, and is not meant to contain any information on how each stat or sensitivity works.
The information in-game, or on the `wiki <https://monstergirldreams.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Girl_Dreams_Wiki>`_ should prove sufficient for that purpose.

**Stats**
----------

Core stats are internally refereed to as:

* ``"Power"``
* ``"Technique"``
* ``"Intelligence"``
* ``"Allure"``
* ``"Willpower"``
* ``"Luck"``

To get their maximum stat of the following:

* ``"Arousal"``
* ``"Energy"``
* ``"Spirit"``

Alternatively, to get their current amount:

* ``"CurrentArousal"``
* ``"CurrentEnergy"``
* ``"CurrentSpirit"``

.. _Sensitivity:

**Sensitivity Reference**
--------------------------

Above 100 is more sensitive, below 100 is less sensitive.

* ``"Sex"`` (Counts as the player's Cock sensitivity and the Monster's Pussy sensitivity respectively)
* ``"Ass"``
* ``"Breasts"`` (Counts as the player's Nipple sensitivity internally)
* ``"Mouth"``
* ``"Seduction"``
* ``"Magic"``
* ``"Pain"``
* ``"Holy"``
* ``"Unholy"``

**Equations**
--------------

You can use the following equations when considering the balance of your stats. You are free to deviate if you feel something needs tuned in a particular way.

**Eros Per Enemy Level**

For calculating how much Eros the player should earn when defeating a enemy. ``x`` represents the given level.

::

  (x)^2+(x*10)+48

**Exp Amount Per Player Level**

For graphing how much Exp the player is required to collect before leveling up. ``x`` represents the given level.

This can be used to decide how much Exp you want a monster to give. Threshold typically does 60-100% of the Exp for the level the enemy is at relative to the graph.

::

  (0.4*(x*x))+(2*x)+(15*sqrt(x)-8)
