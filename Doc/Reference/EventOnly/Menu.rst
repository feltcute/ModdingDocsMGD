**Menu System**
================

.. _Menu:

**Menu**
---------
Gives the player an option menu of choices. Each choice is a scene in the same event file. Make sure the scene names exactly match the choice.
Will always end current scene and jump to a new one, thus it is recommended to only have them at the end of a scene.

::

  "Menu",
    "I hate tacos.",
    "I love tacos.",
    "Tacos are okay.",
    "I like taco soup!",
  "EndLoop"

By default, if there are more than 6 choices, page arrows will automatically be added.

**Meta Functions**
-------------------

.. _MaxMenuslots:

**MaxMenuSlots**
"""""""""""""""""
Sets the max number of menu options available per menu page, not counting :ref:`FinalOption`.
**MaxMenuSlots must be called first at the start of the ``"Menu"`` loop. Maximum of 6, minimum of 1**

This is useful if the menu choices have a high character count, which can otherwise clip with the player status and dialogue box.

::

  "Menu", "MaxMenuSlots", "2",
    "A choice",
    "Another choice.",
    "This will be on the second page",
    "This choice is also on the second page",
    "A choice on the third page.",
  "EndLoop"

**ShuffleMenu**
""""""""""""""""
Randomly shuffles the menu choices, to be declared at the start of the menu.

Keep in mind :ref:`FinalOption` disregards this.

::

  "Menu", "ShuffleMenu",
    "Touch the butt.",
    "Don’t touch the butt.",
  "EndLoop"

.. _FinalOption:

**FinalOption**
""""""""""""""""
Forces a menu option to always be the last available option in the list.
**If there are multiple pages, it will be at the bottom of every page, and does not count towards** :ref:`MaxMenuSlots`.

It is recommended to avoid using :ref:`Requirement Sub-Functions` alongside this function’s target, as this is intended for giving the player back-out options.
If you do use the functionality for your ``"FinalOption"`` choice, please ensure ``"FinalOption"`` is the last sub-function that's provided prior
to the choice.

::

  "Menu",
    "FinalOption", "Done talking.",
    "Ask if they ever wondered why we're here in this box canyon.",
    "Something that was added in with a menu addition.",
  "EndLoop"

**EventJump & ThenJumpToScene**
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Makes the following option jump to the given event instead of a scene. ``"ThenJumpToScene"`` has it jump to a specific scene in that event.

These can be used with :ref:`FinalOption` if desired.

::

  "Menu",
    "EventJump", "Lumiren's Song", "Final Option", "See the Lumiren.",
    "EventJump", "Lava Hot Spring", "Go and hear dad jokes.",
    "EventJump", "'Bon Bon Bun'", "ThenJumpToScene", "StoreMenuReal", "Candy!",
  "EndLoop"

.. _HideOptionOnRequirementFail:

    "Take the elevator.",
  "EndLoop"

**InverseRequirement**
"""""""""""""""""""""""
Can be called before a choice with any requirement check to reverse the true/false conditions of any requirement checks for a given choice.
Can be used with :ref:`HideOptionOnRequirementFail`, and technically :ref:`FinalOption`.

::

    "Menu",
      "InverseRequirement", "RequiresPerk", "Swift", "I'm very slow.",
      "RequiresPerk", "Swift", "I'm fast!",

    "EndLoop"

.. _Displayed Requirement Sub-Functions:

**Displayed Requirement Sub-Functions**
----------------------------------------
You can use any of the functions here to make require the player to meet a condition before being presented with the menu choice.
**If the player fails the requirement, the conditions will be displayed.**

Multiple check conditions can be given before providing the choice. Do note only the first requirement given in a multi-condition choice can display upon failing.
Threshold usually prefers to disable it via :ref:`HideOptionOnRequirementFail` where sensible.
