**Introduction**
=================

**Welcome to the Monster Girl Dreams Modding Documentation for v25.5a**.
Here you can find information, reference, and starter guides for all JSON modding related practices.
It features general starter information, all existing functions, and code block examples for everything you can do within the games custom scripting system.
It assumes you already have at least a fair bit of experience with the game,
understand its stats via hovering over them in your character profile, and a familiar understanding of its mechanics.

Potential game spoilers abound.

.. note::

  The game is still in active alpha development. Mods you make aren't guaranteed to work with the latest version of the game.
  Your mods are entirely up to you to maintain, unless someone decides to patch your mod for you.
  Warning probably sounds scarier than it actually is.

**Navigating The Docs**
------------------------

The documentation can be navigated using the List of Contents below, and in the navigation column to the left.
You can use the buttons at the bottom of each page if you wish to go through the documentation linearly.
Of particular relevance to people new to modding will be the Starter section. Click 'Text Editors', or press the 'Next' button at the bottom of this page to begin.
